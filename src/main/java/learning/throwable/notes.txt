[?] How is happening memory allocation for heap and stack?
- The size of the heap can be specified using –Xms VM option.
The heap can be of fixed size or variable size depending on the garbage collection strategy.
Maximum heap size can be set using –Xmx option. By default, the maximum heap size is set to 64 MB.
The default maximum size of non-heap memory is 64 MB. This can be changed using –XX:MaxPermSize VM option.
