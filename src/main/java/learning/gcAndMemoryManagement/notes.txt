memory model broken into smaller parts:
1. Young generation - all new objects. When fills up, minor GC occurs
2. Old Generation - for all objects there is threshold, when this threshold is reached, object moved here
[?] How threshold resolved?
- Old generation memory contains the objects that are long-lived and survived after many rounds of Minor GC.
XX:SurvivorRatio used for providing ratio of Eden space, for example, if young generation size is 10m
and VM switch is â€“XX:SurvivorRatio=2 then 5m will be reserved for Eden space and 2.5m each for both the Survivor spaces.
The default value is 8
XX:NewRatio used for providing ratio of old/new generation sizes. The default value is 2
3. Permanent generation - JVM metadata for the runtime classes and application methods
